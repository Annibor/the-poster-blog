## Testing

- Throughout the whole development of the webpage, I've made tests in:

### DevTools

- Troughout the development I've used Devtools to inspect and test the website to be able to make the best I could for it.

### Lighthouse

#### Issues

- 
- ![]()

- 

- ![]()

#### Results

- JSHint test for Javascript code.

- ![]()

### Manual testing

I tested the website manualy throughout the whole developing progress. The website is tested in Safari, Google Chrome and Brave. The website is also tested from an Iphone.

## Deployment

I deployed early to be able to test the website deployed during the development. Following step are a description of how to deploy a webpage on GitHub:

1. Open the []() and find the Settings tab.
2. The navigate to the tab called Pages on the left.
3. Choose to Deploy from a branch. For me it was the main branch.
4. Save it. It can take a few minutes, but then you will be able to find the link to the deployed website in the repository on the menu to the right, under []().
5. There you'll find the daployes website no top of the page under the heading Active deployments.

## Languages

- This CLI was built using python.

## Software

- I've used Visual Studio Code to write the code.
- I've used Git to load and push my code to Github and for version control.
- I've used GitHub for repository management.
- I've used Code Pen to test and change my code, without ruining the actual project.
- I've used preinstalled app called "Prevew" to edit the sizes of the photos.
- I've used Coolors.co to find a color palette for the website.
- I've also used Coolors.co to contrast check text colors and background colors.
- I've used maketintsandshades.com to find evetuals tints and shadow colors as a complement for the color palette.
- I've used Balsamiq when I made the wireframes for the website.
- I've used cssgradient.io to make the background gradient.
- I've used Chat GPT and google translate for some translations and questions.
