## Planning & developmnet

## Agile Planning

The development of *The Poster Blog* was meticulously planned and executed following agile methodologies. This section outlines the user stories and epics that guided the development process, ensuring that each feature not only meets the users' expectations but also enriches their interaction with the blog.

### Structuring Development with User Stories

At the heart of my agile planning were the User Stories - the narratives that captured the essence of what the users, both general visitors and registered members, sought from *The Poster Blog*. These stories facilitated a deep understanding of the audience's needs, guiding the development process from a user-centric perspective.

### Task Breakdown and Epic Creation

Each User Story sparked a series of tasks - specific, actionable steps designed to bring that story to life. These tasks ranged from frontend design tweaks to backend functionality enhancements, each contributing to the blog's overall appeal and usability. By grouping related tasks into Epics, I could maintain a coherent development flow while keeping an eye on the bigger picture. This grouping also allowed me to tackle the blog's features systematically, ensuring that every aspect of the user experience was thoughtfully crafted and implemented.

### Prioritization with MoSCoW Method

To navigate the myriad of development tasks efficiently, I used the MoSCoW method of prioritization:

- **Must Have**: Core functionalities that were essential for the blog's launch, such as the ability to view and interact with blog posts.
- **Should Have**: Important features that enhance the user experience, like the About page that offers deeper insights into the blog's purpose and Izzy's artistic journey.
- **Could Have**: Additional features that, while not critical, could further enrich the blog, including enhanced styling and responsive design elements.
- **Won't Have (this time)**: Ideas that were put on hold for future development, allowing us to focus on the most impactful features first.

### Adaptive Development and Reflection

Embracing the agile framework, I embraced adaptability, seamlessly integrating feedback and addressing the evolving needs throughout the development of The Poster Blog. The journey began with the cornerstone elementsâ€”laying down the blog's structural foundation and establishing mechanisms for user interaction. This initial step set the stage for a broader, more nuanced expansion, allowing the blog to not merely serve as a digital platform, but to emerge as a vibrant, interactive community space that grows in tandem with its audience's engagement and artistic appreciation.

The creation of The Poster Blog, guided by the principles of agile planning, stands as a testament to the profound impact of centering user needs and embracing an iterative approach to development. This commitment to refining the user experience continues to be the driving force as I further develop this foundation, inspired by the agile ethos that has been instrumental to our progress thus far.

Throughout this process, the agile methodologyâ€”characterized by user stories and epicsâ€”served as a beacon, ensuring that each feature not only meets but exceeds user expectations. This strategic approach enabled a development trajectory that was both focused and flexible, capable of adapting to the shifting landscape of user needs and feedback.

As a result, The Poster Blog has evolved into more than a showcase of Izzy's artistic journey; it has become a thriving community hub for art lovers. Through careful planning and execution of these epics, the blog has cultivated an environment where creativity flourishes, and the collective passion for art draws users into a deeper, more meaningful engagement with the content.

### User-Centered Approach

For The Poster Blog, I've prioritize the users' experience above all. The design and development processes are deeply rooted in a user-centered approach, ensuring that the platform is not only visually appealing but also accessible, engaging, and easy to navigate. Here's how I've tailored The Poster Blog to our audience:

**Accessibility**
- Universal Design: 
I've implemented a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across devices and screen sizes, ensuring that all users, regardless of how they access the blog, have a uniform experience.

- Accessibility Features:
From high-contrast color schemes to keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility, I've taken steps to make The Poster Blog inclusive for users with diverse accessibility needs.

**Engagement and Interaction**
- Community Engagement: 
Users can actively participate in the artistic journey through comments, fostering a vibrant community of art enthusiasts.

- User Feedback:
We've made it easy for users to like posts, providing immediate feedback to Izzy and allowing her to gauge which topics resonate most with her audience.

**Intuitive Navigation**
- Streamlined Interface: The blog features a clean, organized layout that guides users naturally through content and minimizing distractions.

- Discoverability: 
With a clear and concise menu, users can effortlessly find content categories, blog, and more, enhancing their ability to discover new posts and topics of interest.

By placing our users at the heart of The Poster Blog's development, we strive to create an online space that not only showcases Izzy's artistic talent but also builds a supportive and engaged community around her work.

### Database schema
- **User Model (Django AllAuth)**: Serves as the central model, linking to other models like posts, comments, and likes for comprehensive user interaction within the platform.

- **Category Model**: Categorizes posts into distinct groups. Fields include a unique `name` and `slug` for URL handling. Categories help organize posts for easier navigation and discovery by users.

- **Post Model**: Represents the core content of the platform - the blog posts themselves. Each post is linked to admin (as the author) and categorized under `Category`. Essential fields include `title`, `slug`, `content`, and `status` (draft or published), facilitating rich content presentation and management.

- **Comment Model**: Enables users to engage with posts through comments. Each comment is associated with a `Post` and a `User` (author of the comment), and includes a `body`, approval status, and timestamp. Admin approval is required for comments to be visible, ensuring quality control.

- **Like Model**: Allows users to express their appreciation for posts. It prevents duplicate likes on a single post by a user through a unique together constraint on `User` and `Post`, enhancing the interactive experience of the platform.

- The platform supports full CRUD operations on posts within user-interested categories, fostering a dynamic blogging environment.
- Commenting feature enriches user engagement, with an approval mechanism in place to maintain content relevance and quality.
- Like functionality introduces a simple yet effective form of user interaction with content, promoting a more connected and interactive community.

## Deployment

This section guides you through the deployment of an project on Heroku, including handling different branches and deployment preferences.

### Preparing for Deployment

Ensure your project includes a `requirements.txt` and a `Procfile`, which are essential for Heroku to understand how to run your application.

1. **requirements.txt**: Generate this file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to list all necessary Python packages.
2. **Procfile**: Create this file in your project's root directory with the content: `web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi`, replacing `your_project_name` with the name of your Django project.

### Deploying to Heroku

1. **Create a Heroku Account**: Sign up at [Heroku's website](https://signup.heroku.com/).
2. **Create a Heroku App**: Use `heroku create your-app-name`, substituting `your-app-name` with your desired app name.
3. **Set Config Vars**: Navigate to your app's settings on the Heroku dashboard, under "Config Vars", set:
    - `SECRET_KEY`: Your Django secret key.
    - `DATABASE_URL`: The database URL, typically provided by Heroku Postgres.
    - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: If using Cloudinary for media storage, your Cloudinary URL.

### Managing Branches and Deployment Options

1. **Branch Management**: If your development involves multiple branches, Heroku deploys from the main branch by default. To deploy from a different branch, use `git push heroku your-branch-name:main`, replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch.

2. **Automatic vs. Manual Deployment**:
   - **Automatic Deployment**: In the Heroku dashboard, under the "Deploy" tab, you can connect your GitHub repository and enable automatic deploys from your chosen branch. This means any push to the selected branch automatically triggers a deployment.
   - **Manual Deployment**: If you prefer more control over when your changes go live, stick with manual deployments using the `git push heroku main` command for the main branch, or the appropriate branch name if deploying from a non-main branch.

3. **Deployment Preference**: You can switch between automatic and manual deployments based on your project's needs. For instance, automatic deployments are convenient for continuous delivery environments, while manual deployments offer more control for testing and final approvals before going live.

### Final Steps

1. **Run Migrations**: Execute `python3 manage.py makemigrations` `python3 manage.py migrate` to apply database migrations.
2. **Access Your App**: Open your app in a browser with `heroku open` or by visiting `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`.

### Forking and Cloning (Optional)

- **Forking**: Click 'Fork' on the GitHub repository page to copy the project under your account.
- **Cloning**: Use `git clone copied-url` with the URL from the 'Code' button on GitHub to clone the repository for local development.

## What I've Learned


In developing this project, I've embarked on a journey that was both challenging and immensely rewarding. Here are some reflections on what I've learned along the way:

- **Problems**:
I had a lot of problems with changes that I made in the code came back after som git commits. Here I will show an example of code that I deleted, and after some git commits tha code was back, and I had to delete it again:
- [Changed Code Back](/documentation/otherimages/changed-code-back.png)
- [Changed Code Back 2](/documentation/otherimages/changed-code-back-2.png)
- [Changed Code Back 3](/documentation/otherimages/changed-code-back-3.png)

- **Adaptability in Problem-Solving**: I encountered numerous challenges, from bugs in the code to design hurdles. Each issue required a unique solution, teaching me the importance of adaptability and perseverance. It was a reminder that problem-solving is a dynamic process that often requires thinking outside the box.

- **Depth of Django and Python**: This project deepened my understanding of Django and Python, particularly in how they can be leveraged to create robust web applications. I've gained a greater appreciation for Django's ORM, class-based views, and the powerful templating system, which together make it easier to build and manage dynamic content.

- **The Importance of User-Centric Design**: Throughout the development, the focus remained on creating an intuitive and accessible user experience. This project reinforced the principle that design should always prioritize the needs and preferences of the user. It's not just about aesthetic appeal but about creating interfaces that are logical, navigable, and inclusive.

- **Agile Development Practices**: Implementing agile methodologies, such as breaking down the project into smaller, manageable epics and user stories, was instrumental in maintaining focus and efficiency. It highlighted the value of flexibility in the development process and the need for continuous iteration based on feedback.

- **The Joy of Learning**: Above all, this project has been a testament to the joy of learning. Each obstacle overcome and each functionality successfully implemented was a reminder of why I love coding: the constant cycle of learning, creating, and improving is deeply fulfilling.

- **Early Testing with W3C Validation**: One crucial strategy I learned was the importance of conducting early and frequent tests with W3C validators. This approach helped identify and rectify markup errors and compatibility issues sooner, minimizing potential headaches down the line. It underscored the value of integrating best practices and standards compliance from the start of the development process, ensuring a more stable and accessible end product.

As I reflect on this project, I'm grateful for the opportunities it has provided to grow as a developer. The lessons learned extend beyond technical skills; they encompass the softer skills of patience, resilience, and creative thinking, which are equally valuable in this ever-evolving field.
